# Healthcare and Bioinformatics Data Analysis
This repo contains the final assignments of the Data Analyst bootcamp by Workearly. I used Python and SQL to clean, transform, and analyze healthcare, bioinformatics and finance datasets. I also created clear figures to visualize the findings using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.
